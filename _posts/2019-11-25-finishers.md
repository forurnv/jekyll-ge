Power trowels differ in the way they are controlled:
Ride-on power trowels are used by an operator sitting on a seat upon the machinery, controlling the power trowel with the necessary buttons.
Walk-behind power trowels are used by an operator walking behind the machine.
A hand tool for the same task is called a concrete float.
